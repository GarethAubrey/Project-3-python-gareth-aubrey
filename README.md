# Work Hours Python Project


</div>

## Motivation for project

In my current job as a security controller one of our main issues is keeping up with the staff’s hours of work as they are flexible depending on business’s needs, the python project i have created will be used to keep up with the hours worked by different members of the team. This software will allow management to add up total hours for all staff which will also help towards budgets for the current year and future years.

I achieved the end goal using the Love Sandwiches Walk through project from Code Institute, this walk through allowed me to set the base code but then I was able to change the relevant parts to suit my own needs.

### Screenshots and technology used

Below you will see some screen shots from the google sheets after some data has been added by the user -

The above screen shot is the raw data from the user which is then placed under the name of the employee.

The above screen shot is the second worksheet from the google sheet, the information that is provided in the first spreadsheet by the user is then calculated by google sheets to show the total amount of hours worked by each employee and is then added together for a total amount of hours worked by all employees.


Below is a screenshot of the program as it starts up for the user, once the user has put the data in the program will run and tell the user what it is doing and when it is complete as shown on the following screenshot -

</div>

If Wrong data has been provided then the program will tell the user that they have entered the wrong amount and the program will start again as screenshot below shows -

## Features left to implement

Some features I would like to implement in the future are, another worksheet for staff holidays and that will be linked to the total hours worksheet as the staff all receive holiday pay. The main feature I would like to add would be a pie chart that would allow management to see how the hours are being spread out amongst the staff, this will allow the management to make changes if needed and will help in appraisals at the end of the year.
