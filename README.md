# Work Hours Python Project


</div>

## Motivation for project

In my current job as a security controller one of our main issues is keeping up with the staff’s hours of work as they are flexible depending on business’s needs, the python project i have created will be used to keep up with the hours worked by different members of the team. This software will allow management to add up total hours for all staff which will also help towards budgets for the current year and future years.

I achieved the end goal using the Love Sandwiches Walk through project from Code Institute, this walk through allowed me to set the base code but then I was able to change the relevant parts to suit my own needs.
